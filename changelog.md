# Changelog v1.1: Technical Update

This update introduces a number of new changes. Firstly, I rebuilt much of the site from a visual perspective. The foundation is much better now, and should allow us to continue to improve the aesthetics as time goes by. 

I also spent some time fixing the site from a technical perspective. You can expect greatly improved reliability, performance, and speed.

Features: 
 * Improved the appearance of just about everything.
    * New checkboxes.
    * New flash messages.
    * New header and footer.
    * Reworked calendar.
    * More modals!
