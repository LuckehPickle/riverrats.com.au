## Branches

We follow the branching model outlined in the article [A successful Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). If you can't be bothered to read all that, here's the important bits.

There are two main branches:

 1. `master`: The current production version of the website.
 2. `develop`: Where future releases are under construction. Unless you're writing a bug fix you'll likely want to start here.

Then there are three types of supporting branches:

 * `feature-*`: A branch which introduces a new feature. e.g. `feature-player-nicknames`.
 * `release-*`: A branch devoted to polishing up the project for a new release. e.g. `release-1.2.1`. Note that only project maintainers will create this kind of branch.
 * `hotfix-*`: For fixing bugs in production.
